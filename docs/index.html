          <h2>Why Dense UIs Matter</h2>
          <p>For some UIs, efficient is more important than pretty.</p>
        </header>
        <p>
          My one hot take on UI design systems is that most of them are only
          made to look pretty. They are not made to be efficient. They are not
          made to be data dense. They are not made to be accessible. They are
          not made to be easy to use. They are not made to be intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Believe it or not, it's actually easy to make a UI look pretty.
          There's a handful of tricks that one can apply to get consistently
          good looking UIs. These involve things like using a generous amounts
          of whitespace, very light borders and shadows, relatively low contrast
          colors, etc. As long as your overall UI layout makes sense, these
          things will make your UI look
          <i>pretty</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem, of course, is that tons of whitespace doesn't work very
          well for data dense UIs.
